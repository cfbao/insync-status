# Insync Status

Command line tool to print Insync status. Windows only.

This script works by capturing Insync's system tray icon and compare it with those in Insync's installation folder.
For this to work, Insync must be installed in its default location and Insync system tray icon must be visible:
* Taskbar must not auto-hide
* Screen saver must not be on
* Lock screen and turned off display don't matter though
